Generate a diverse list of short, realistic environment descriptions for natural habitats where the {subject} species could appear.
Each description should be concise (ideally under 15 words).
Start directly with phrases like "in...", "beside...", "under...", "among...", etc.
Do NOT mention or imply the {subject} itself (e.g., do not say "habitat of a bear").
Avoid overly poetic or overly detailed sentences that are hard to visualize.
Use clear, neutral, realistic language focusing on simple background elements like forests, rivers, meadows, mountains, snow, etc.
These descriptions will be combined with a separate fixed prompt about the {subject} and sent to an image generation model. The goal is to teach the model to vary the background while keeping the {subject} consistent for classification purposes.
Output format: A txt file, one short description per line, 100 line.
